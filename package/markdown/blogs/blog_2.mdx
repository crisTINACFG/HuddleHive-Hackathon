After hosting its first successful gathering, the Creative Connections Meetup found an amazing venue host through Gatherly who was eager to support our vision. 

Using Gatherly’s platform felt simple and straightforward. 

We browsed available spaces, found a perfect match, and connected directly with the venue host, who was friendly, responsive, and genuinely excited to help us create a welcoming environment.

The venue itself was fantastic: spacious, inspiring, and full of character, providing the ideal backdrop for artists, designers, and innovators to connect and collaborate. 

Thanks to this perfect space and the positive experience with the host, our event is now set to become a recurring meetup, bringing the creative community together month after month.
