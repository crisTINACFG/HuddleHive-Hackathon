We’re excited to share that the Energy Network has found an ideal new co-working space right in the city’s center—a true milestone for our community. For months, we searched for a venue that would not only be centrally located and accessible but also offer a collaborative environment that fuels innovation and connection.

Gatherly made that search easier by connecting us with a space perfectly suited to our needs. This new venue isn’t just an office; it’s a dynamic hub designed to support workshops, networking events, and project collaborations. With its modern layout, ample meeting rooms, and inspiring atmosphere, it’s the perfect place for energy professionals and enthusiasts to come together and share ideas.

Having a central, welcoming space energizes our network, allowing us to grow stronger as a community and push forward on sustainability initiatives. We’re grateful to Gatherly for helping us find a home that truly reflects our mission of fostering innovation and inclusivity in the energy sector.

We look forward to welcoming our members and partners to this space and continuing to power progress together.
